# Crystal Collector

In this Crystal Collector game we make the compuuter choose a random number from 19 to 120. Once the computer chooses a number, 
we assign random values from 1-12 to each of the four crystals that are displayed on the page. Once the game begins, the player
must choose a random crystal, whos value will be added to their score. The player must then remember the value of each crystal 
to successfully make their score equal to the random number that the computer chose. If the player does the math wrong, or if they 
cannot remember how much each crystal is worth, and their score goes above the value of the computer's choice, then the player looses. 

Once the player looses, the computer then chooses a new value, and changes the value of each of the crystals, and the game starts 
another round. each time the player wins or looses, their win and lose counters are updated accordingly.
